        <module-box header-text="'Ontology Editor'" icon-name="'pencil-square-o'" background-color="'#337ab7'">
            The MatOnto web-based ontology editor provides a Distributed Ontology Management System (DOMS) for local and community development and evolution of Web Ontology Language (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/">OWL</a>) ontologies. The DOMS features a customizable user interface, knowledge capture, collaboration, access policy management, ontology reuse, and extensibility.

        <module-box header-text="'Mapping Tool'" icon-name="'map-o'" background-color="'#5cb85c'">
            The MatOnto web-based Mapping Tool allows users to define custom, ontology-driven definitions to control and execute input data transformations to the Resource Description Framework (<a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>) semantic data model. User-defined mappings load semantic data into the MatOnto store for analysis, sharing and linking.
        </module-box>
        <module-box header-text="'SPARQL Editor'" icon-name="'terminal'" background-color="'#d9534f'">
            The MatOnto web-based <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/">SPARQL</a> editor allows users to formulate and execute queries of semantic data. Users can save, publish, share and reuse their SPARQL queries as part of applications or larger workflows.
        </module-box>
        <module-box header-text="'Catalog'" icon-name="'book'" background-color="'#e59400'">
            The MatOnto web-based Catalog allows users to publish data, dataset descriptions, analytics and other resources. It allows users to control the way their data is shared. MatOnto catalogs join in a federated architecture and share resources based on defined policy.
