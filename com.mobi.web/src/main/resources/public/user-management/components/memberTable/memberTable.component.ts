 * @description
 * `memberTable` is a component that creates a table of the passed members and provides functionality for adding
 * members to the and removing members from list. The exact method of adding and removing is determined by the
 * provided `addMember` and `removeMember` functions. When the "Add Member" link is clicked, a row is added to the
 * table contains a `ui-select` with the available users to add to the member list. Once a user has been
 * selected in the `ui-select`, it will be added to the list. If you click off of the `ui-select`, it will be
 * removed. The Add and Remove functionality is only available if the `readOnly` attribute is falsy.
 *
 * @param {boolean} readOnly Whether the table should be read only (i.e. non-editable)
 * @param {string[]} members The list of members names to display in the table
 * @param {Function} removeMember The method to call when a member is removed from the list. Expects an argument
 * called `member`
 * @param {Function} addMember The method to call when a member is added to the list. Expects an argument called
 * `member`
 * @param {boolean} linkToUser Whether the usernames should be links to viewing the user in the
 * {@link user-management.component:usersPage}
