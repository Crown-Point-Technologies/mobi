 * `dropOnMe` is a directive that allows users to drop on this element. This should be used in tandem with the `dragMe`
 * directive. The "dropId" attribute is a unique identifier to match up to a "dragId" which allows dropping the dragged
 * element on this element. The "onDrop" attribute is a function that will be executed with the "data" provided by the
 * dragged element.
