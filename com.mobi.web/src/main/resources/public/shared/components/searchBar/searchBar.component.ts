 * @description
 * `searchBar` is a component that creates a Bootstrap '.input-group' div element with an input for searching a list
 * of items. The search will be submitted when the enter button is clicked. The component takes a function to be
 * called when the search is submitted. The value of the input is bound to `bindModel`, but only one way. The
 * provided `changeEvent` function is expected to update the value of `bindModel`.
 *
 * @param {string} bindModel The contents of the search input
 * @param {Function} changeEvent The function to be called when the text of the input changes. Should update the
 * value of `bindModel`. Expects an argument called `value`
 * @param {Function} submitEvent The function to be called when the enter button is clicked
