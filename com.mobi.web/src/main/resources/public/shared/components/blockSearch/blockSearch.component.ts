/**
 * @ngdoc component
 * @name shared.component:blockSearch
 *
 * @description

 * search bar contains a text input and a clear button. The search text is bound to `bindModel`, but only one way.
 * The provided `changeEvent` function is expected to update the value of `bindModel`. The behavior when the clear
 * button is clicked is controlled by the provided `clearEvent` function.
 * 
 * @param {string} bindModel The variable bound to the search text input.
 * @param {Function} changeEvent A function that is called when the value of the text input changes. Should update
 * the value of `bindModel`. Expects an argument called `value`.
 * @param {Function} clearEvent A function that is called when the clear button is clicked.
