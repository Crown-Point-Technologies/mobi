/**
 * @ngdoc component
 * @name shared.component:keywordSelect
 * 
 * @description
 * `keywordSelect` is a component that creates a `ui-select` for editing keywords on an entity in Mobi. The label
 * for the select shows as Optional. The value of the select is bound to `bindModel`, but only one way. The provided
 * `changeEvent` function is expected to update the value of `bindModel`.
 * 
 * @param {string[]} bindModel An array of strings representing keywords that are bound to the `ui-select`
 * @param {Function} changeEvent A function that will be called when the value of the `ui-select` changes. Should
 * update the value of `bindModel`. Expects an argument called `value`.
 * @param {boolean} [hideLabel=false] Whether the label should be hidden.
 * @param {string} isFocusMe Whether the `ui-select` should be focused once rendered. The presence of the attribute
 * is enough to set it.
