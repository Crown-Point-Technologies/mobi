/**
 * @ngdoc component
 * @name shared.component:circleButtonStack
 * 
 * @description
 * `circleButtonStack` is a component that creates a Bootstrap circle button (`button.btn-float`) which reveals
 * transcluded content on hover. The transcluded content is expected to be a series of circle buttons with icons
 * inside that perform a variety of actions on click. The expectation is that the last button in the stack will be
 * "normal" size and the other will be sized smaller with the Bootstrap `btn-sm` class.Best practice is to also use
 * a {@link shared.directive:buttonHoverText} on each button to provide context as to what the button will do.
 * 
 * @usage
 * <circle-button-stack>
 *     <button class="btn btn-float btn-success btn-sm" button-hover-text="Secondray Action"></button>
 *     <button class="btn btn-float btn-primary" button-hover-text="Main Action"></button>
 * </circle-button-stack>
