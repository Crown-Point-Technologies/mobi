/**
 * @ngdoc component
 * @name shared.component:paging
 *
 * @description
 * `paging` is a component that creates a div element with a `uib-pagination` and some text describing the current
 * page of the pagination. The display states which items are showing as well as the total. The pagination begins at
 * the provided 1-based index of a page. The component expects that the provided `changeEvent` function will update
 * the value of `currentPage` when directional buttons are clicked.
 *
 * @param {number} total The total number of results
 * @param {number} currentPage The index of the current page (1 based)
 * @param {number} limit The limit on the number of items per page
 * @param {Function} changeEvent The function to be called when a directional button is clicked. Should update the
 * value of `currentPage`. Expects an argument called `page`
