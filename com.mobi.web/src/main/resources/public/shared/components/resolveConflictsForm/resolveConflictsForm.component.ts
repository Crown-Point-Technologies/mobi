/**
 * @ngdoc component
 * @name shared.component:resolveConflictsForm
 *
 * @description
 * `resolveConflictsForm` is a component that creates displays of conflicts from a merge of VersionedRDFRecord
 * branches and ways to resolve those conflicts. The initial view is a list of the conflicts displayed as the entity
 * titles and their resolution statuses. Once a conflict is selected, the view changes to a side-by-side display of
 * the changes from each branch in the conflict. Clicking on one of the displays selects which changes to keep in
 * the resolution. The conflicts should in the form:
 * ```
 * {
 *     iri: '',
 *     resolved: '',
 *     left: {
 *         additions: [],
 *         deletions: []
 *     },
 *     right: {
 *         additions: [],
 *         deletions: []
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * @param {Object[]} conflicts The conflicts to be resolved in the form
 * @param {string} branchTitle The title of the source branch of the merge
 * @param {string} targetTitle The title of the target branch of the merge
