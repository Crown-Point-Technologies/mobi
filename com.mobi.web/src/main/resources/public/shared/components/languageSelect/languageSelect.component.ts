/**
 * @ngdoc component
 * @name shared.component:languageSelect
 * @requires shared.service:propertyManagerService
 *
 * @description
 * `languageSelect` is a component which provides options for a formatted ui-select for picking language tags. The
 * select is bound to `bindModel`, but only one way. The provided `changeEvent` function is expected to update the
 * value of `bindModel`. The component provides an option to have a clear selection button. If the button is not
 * enabled, the choice defaults to English.
 *
 * @param {string} bindModel The variable to bind the value of the language to
 * @param {Function} changeEvent A function that is called when the value of the select changes. Should update the
 * value of `bindModel`. Expects an argument called `value`
 * @param {boolean} disableClear A boolean that indicates if the clear button should be disabled
 * @param {boolean} required Whether the select is a required field. The presence of the attribute is enough to set
 * the value to true
